            It is a period of civil war. <br />
            Rebel spaceships, striking <br />
            from a hidden base, have won <br />
            their first victory against <br />
            the evil Galactic Empire. <br />
            <br />
            During the battle, Rebel <br />
            spies managed to steal secret <br />
            plans to the Empire's <br />
            ultimate weapon, the DEATH <br />
            STAR, an armored space <br />
            station with enough power to <br />
            destroy an entire planet. <br />
            <br />
            Pursued by the Empire's <br />
            sinister agents, Princess <br />
            Leia races home aboard her <br />
            starship, custodian of the <br />
            stolen plans that can save <br />
            her people and restore <br />
            freedom to the galaxy....
